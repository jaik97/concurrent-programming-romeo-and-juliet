# Concurrent Programming with Romeo and Juliet

## Objective
The project involves implementing a concurrent system using Java and TCP/IP client-server architecture. Inspired by Romeo and Juliet, the scenario doesn't require prior knowledge of the play. The project demonstrates proficiency in concurrent programming, network communication, and computational simulation within a Java environment, offering an interactive portrayal of Romeo and Juliet's love story through computational means.

## Features
- **Client-Server Communication:** Utilizes TCP/IP protocol for communication between a client (Playwriter) and two servers (Romeo and Juliet).
- **ODE Calculation:** Servers compute values of a predefined ordinary differential equation (ODE) simulating the love story.
- **Communication Simulation:** The client interacts with servers, mimicking the exchange of love letters between Romeo and Juliet.
- **File Output:** Generates a novel (RomeoAndJuliet.csv) with annotated ODE values at the end of iterations.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Primary programming language for implementation.
- **TCP/IP:** Facilitates communication between client and servers.
- **Socket Programming:** Establishes communication channels between components.
- **Concurrent Programming:** Utilizes threading for concurrent execution.
